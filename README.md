# Skye

**1. What is the goal of your application?**
I have a dog named Skye and I train her frequently in many different dog sports. My application be similar to a blog where I will post articles on certain training techniques I use. The goal of the application is to provide these training tips and techniques to dog owners without a lot of experience training dogs.

**2. Who is the primary audience?**
The audience of this application is dog owners who want to learn more techniques for training their dogs. Whether their dogs have poor behavior they are trying to train out or they want to learn a new technique, my website will help them.

**3. What will the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations be?**
I will be able to create, update, and delete blog posts with training techniques in my website. To read the blog posts, there will be a page where dog owners can see all blog posts or search them.

**4. What additional feature would you like to build? See the Additional Features section on the project requirements.**
The additional feature I will implement is the bookmarking system. It will be really helpful for owners to save posts they find interesting and want to implement later on.
